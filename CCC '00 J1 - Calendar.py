# CCC '00 J1 - Calendar
# Canadian Computing Competition: 2000 Stage 1, Junior #1
#
# Write a program to print out a calendar for a particular month
# given the day on which the first of the month occurs together with the number of days in the month.
#
# Your program should take as input an integer representing the day of the week on which the month begins
# (1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, â€¦ , 7 for Saturday),
# and an integer which is the number of days in the month (between 28 and 31 inclusive).
# Your program should print the appropriate calendar for the month. You can assume that all input data will be valid.
#
# DMOJ-specific note: None of the output lines should contain trailing whitespace.
# The last line must end with a newline.
