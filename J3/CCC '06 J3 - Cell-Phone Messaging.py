# Canadian Computing Competition: 2006 Stage 1, Junior #3
#
# Joe Coder has just received a cell phone for his birthday. At first he was not so excited about it,
# since he does not like to talk that much, nor listen for that matter,
# and he hates being interrupted by phone calls while coding or playing his favourite computer game.
# But, Joe learned that he can talk to his friends and also send e-mails. That made the phone cool.
#
# In order to fit the 26 letters of the alphabet onto the keys of a cell phone,
# several letters are assigned to each key, as shown on the diagram.
# To write a text message, we have to choose a letter from a set assigned to a key.
# The first letter on a key is chosen by pressing the key once, the second letter by pressing the key twice,
# third letter by pressing the key three times, and so on.
#
# For example, to write a we press the key 2 once and we are done;
# to write dada we press 3232â€”four key presses; and to write bob we press 2266622.
#
# An obvious issue is how to write two consecutive letters on the same key, for example in abba or cell.
# The problem is solved by introducing a time-out feature:
# a letter currently displayed is chosen when another key is pressed, but also after a pause, i.e., a time out.
# Hence for example, to write abba we press 2-pause-22-pause-22-pause-2;
# to write cell we press 22233555-pause-555; or to write www we press 9-pause-9-pause-9.
#
# This kind of typing takes some time,
# and Joe is working on a program to calculate how much time is needed to type certain words.
# His assumption is that he spends one second per press,
# and whenever he makes a pause he loses an additional two seconds.
# You are to help him to calculate the minimal time needed to type a message, under the above assumptions.

# Input
# Each line of input contains a word consisting only of lowercase letters. Words have at most 20 characters.
# Input will be given from the keyboard, and the program should stop reading input when the word halt has been entered.

# Output
# For each input word (excluding the word halt), print (on the screen)
# the minimal number of seconds needed to type in the word, with one number of output per line.
